# 🍕 Plato’s Pizza Sales Analysis | Excel Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Maven Pizza Challenge**, where I acted as a **Business Intelligence Analyst** hired to help Plato’s Pizza become more data-driven.

The goal was to analyze customer transaction data and build an **Excel dashboard** that uncovers opportunities to increase sales and improve operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
The dashboard was designed to answer key business questions:

- When is the restaurant busiest (by day and hour)?
- How many pizzas are sold during peak periods?
- Which pizzas are the best and worst sellers?
- What is the average order value?
- How efficiently is seating capacity utilized? (15 tables / 60 seats)

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of transactional sales data, structured across multiple tables:

- **Orders**: Order date, time, hour, and day
- **Order Details**: Pizza quantities per order
- **Pizzas**: Pizza size and price
- **Pizza Types**: Pizza name, category, and ingredients
- **Calendar Table**: Date hierarchy for time-based analysis

## 🧩 Data Modeling
A **star schema** was implemented to ensure accurate aggregation and efficient analysis:

- **Fact Tables**: Orders, Order Details  
- **Dimension Tables**: Pizzas, Pizza Types, Calendar  

This structure enables flexible analysis by time, product, size, and category.
